## Learning Source
This project was built as part of the **Intro to REST API** course by [Mohamed Abu-Hadhoud] on the **Programming Advices** platform.  
It was my first backend API project, and it helped me understand RESTful architecture, layered design, and ADO.NET for database integration.

Special thanks to the instructor for his clear explanations and practical approach.
